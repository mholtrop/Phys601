    "### Importing numpy and scipy\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to use packages like `numpy` and `scipy` whose functionality is not built into python, you first need to import them.  In order to import any such package in python, not just numpy or scipy, one simply needs to type `import` followed by the name of the package:\n",
    "\n",
    "    import package_name\n",
    "    \n",
    "For example, with `numpy` and `scipy` we would type\n",
    "\n",
    "    import numpy\n",
    "    import scipy\n",
    "    \n",
    "Although this is the simplest way to import such packages, doing so results in a certain syntactical state of affairs that some programmers find irritating; whenever you want to use a function from `numpy` or `scipy`, you'll now have to prepend `numpy.` to the name of any such function.  For example, if you want to use the sine function built into numpy to compute $\\sin(1)$, you'll have to type\n",
    "\n",
    "    numpy.sin(1)\n",
    "    \n",
    "If you're doing a lot of such function calling in the course of your code, typing out `numpy` every time can get annoying, so some coders will import `numpy` and `scipy` with abbreviated names.  In general, for any package, importing with an abbreviated name is done as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    import package_name as abbreviated_name\n",
    "    \n",
    "For example, the standard abbreviations used for `numpy` and `scipy` are `np` and `sp` respectively, so to import them with these abbreviations, we would type\n",
    "\n",
    "    import numpy as np\n",
    "    import scipy as np\n",
    "    \n",
    "Now, if you want to compute $\\sin(1)$, you can type\n",
    "\n",
    "    np.sin(1)\n",
    "    \n",
    "For most people, this abbreviation is sufficiently short as to be usable and not so irritating.  For such people, no further abbreviations or notational tickery are needed, but for those who would prefer to not have to type out `numpy.` or `np.` at all, there are two other options.  The first option is to tell the python interpreter that you just want to import a certain function from the package you're using.  In the `numpy` sine function example, we would type\n",
    "\n",
    "    from numpy import sin\n",
    "    \n",
    "and now we could use the numpy sine function to compute $\\sin(1)$ as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    sin(1)\n",
    "\n",
    "This might seem like the best option, but it has one possibly fatal flaw: suppose that you are using another package that has another implementation of the sine function, then using this last import method that doesn't require prepending something like `numpy.` to the function name when using it, then it might not be clear to you, or something reading your code which implementation of the sine function you're using.  For something as mundane as the sin function, this might not be a big deal since different implementations probably do similar things (actually numpy's sine function does some pretty special things that we'll see soon!), but for a more complicated function, its useful to include something explicit in the syntax indicating which package the function you're using is from.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aside from individually importing each function you want to use to avoid typing `numpy.` or `np.`, one can use the commmand\n",
    "\n",
    "    from numpy import *\n",
    "    \n",
    "This command will simultaneously import *every* function that's in numpy so that you can use it without prepending `numpy.` or `np.` to the function name.  Again, be careful when you do this because not having a prefix in the name of the function makes it unclear which package's implementation of the function you're using.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, it's typically a good idea to import packages you want to use at the very beginning of your code.  For Jupyter notebooks, this means including the lines\n",

    "### Arrays - kind of like numpy's version of lists\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic philosphy of `numpy` as a whole centers on **array-oriented programming**.  Python lists are a wonderful, versatile data container, but for scientific computation, it's often better to use a data container built into numpy called the [**array**](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.html#numpy.ndarray), also referred to as the \"numpy array.\"  An array is a lot like either a list, or a list of lists, or a list of lists of lists, except it's designed so that certain kinds of commonly-performed computations are very efficient.  The array equivalent of a list would be called a one-dimensional array, the array equivalent of a list of lists would be called a two-dimensional array, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "A one-dimensional array is sometimes also called a **vector** and a two-dimensional array is sometimes also called a **matrix**, but if you've taken linear algebra, then you know that the term \"vector\" refers in mathematics to a very general kind of mathematical object that can include arrays of any dimension, so take all of this terminology with a grain of salt.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why use the array-oriented programming philosophy?\n",
    "\n",
    "Among the many [reasons why one might elect to use arrays instead of lists](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/993984/why-numpy-instead-of-python-lists) are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `numpy` arrays use less memory than python lists.\n",
    "2. `numpy` has many functions designed specifically to perform powerful, efficient operations on arrays but not on lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first consideration might be significant if you're doing high-performance computing where memory management is important, but for most reasonably simple scientific computation applications, where memory management isn't such a big concern, the second consideration is still a great reason to elect to use arrays instead of lists.  This should become more clear as we further discuss what can be accomplished with arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "Arrays are not precisely the same as lists.  From a practical perspective, the main difference is that **all elements of an array must have the same type**.  You can't, for example, have an array containing both ints and floats.  This is in stark contrast to lists in which every element of an array can be different from any other element.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "There are at least two straightforward ways to create arrays and fill them with data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Convert a list into an array\n",
    "2. Use a built-in `numpy` function to create the desired array\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose that I want to create an array containing the first 10 positive integers, then I could first create a list containing these numbers (using either a loop or a list comprehension)\n",
    "\n",
    "    integer_list = [n for n in range(1, 11)]\n",
    "    \n",
    "and then I could use the numpy function `array` which can convert a list containing elements of the same type into an array:\n",
    "\n",
    "    integer_array = np.array(integer_list)\n",
    "    \n",
    "A shorter, faster way of creating this array using only `numpy` commands is to use the `arange` function:\n",
    "\n",
    "    another_integer_array = np.arange(1,11)\n",
    "    \n",
    "The [basic syntax for the `arange` function](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.10.1/reference/generated/numpy.arange.html) (whose name is short for \"array range\") is\n",
    "    \n",
    "    np.arange(start, stop, step)\n",
    "    \n",
    "where `start` is the first number is the array, `stop` is the last number (not inclusive) and `step` is the distance between successive numbers in the array and is set to 1 by default.  The fact that the range doesn't include the last number means for example that if you want the last number to be 10, and the step is set to the default of 1, then you need to set `stop` to be 11.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `arange` function was used above to create an example of a \"one-dimensional\" array.  Higher-dimensional arrays are the array equivalent of nested lists, and can also be created with the `array` function.  For example, suppose that we want to convert the the following list of lists into an array:\n",
    "\n",
    "    [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]\n",

    "    np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])\n",

    "This would generate a \"two-dimensional\" array with **shape** `(2, 3)` meaning that the outermost list contains two lists, and each of those sublists contains three elements.  We could also create a three-dimensional array by nesting the lists further:\n",

    "    np.array([[[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]], [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]])\n",

    "### Manipulating arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have created one or more arrays, numpy provides a poweful framework for manipulating these arrays by applying operations to one or more of them.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Applying functions to arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest manifestation of this framework is that numpy functions like it's versions of sine, cosine, and exp called `sin`, `cos`, and `exp` can be applied to a whole array, and the result will be the an array whose elements are the result of applying that function to each element of the array individually!  \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we take the array `integer_array` that we created above which was given by\n",
    "\n",
    "    [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10]\n",
    "\n",
    "and if we type\n",
    "\n",
    "    np.sin(integer_array)\n",
    "    \n",
    "then the output will be an array whose elements are float approximations of $\\sin(1), \\sin(2), \\dots, \\sin(10)$.  Similarly for `cos` and `exp`.  This functionality in numpy is a reflection of a certain powerful kind of function called a [**universal function**](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/ufuncs.html) (or **ufunc** for short) which is a function that operates on numpy arrays element-by-element fashion -- the output of the function evaluated on the array is an array in which the function has been applied to each element of the array.  All of the standard functions in numpy (like trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic) functions are ufuncs by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Applying numerical operations involving a number and an array\n",
    "\n",
    "It was noted above that there is a special `numpy` function called `ones` that creates an array of a specified size with the number 1 in every entry, but what if you want to create an array filled with 13's instead of 1's?  There's not dedicated numpy function called `thirteens` to do this, but there is still a very simple, generalizable way to do it: first use the function `ones` to create an array of the desired size filled with 1's, then multiple every element of the array by the number 13.  You might be skeptical; \"wouldn't we have to use a loop to go through and multiply each element of the array by 13?  Doesn't this defeat the purpose of trying to avoid using loops and instead using native array operations?\"  No!  There is a much simpler way in numpy.  First we create the array having all ones (for simplicity we create an array with 10 elements having all ones)\n",
    "\n",
    "    lots_of_ones = np.ones(10)\n",
    "    \n",
    "Then we just multiply that array by the number 5, and numpy will automatically multiply every element of the array by that number!\n",
    "\n",
    "    lots_of_thirteens = 5 * lots_of_ones\n",
    "    \n",
    "Note that this wouldn't have worked if we had created a *list* of ones -- multiplication by numbers is not an operation that is defined for lists in standard python syntax, but it is defined for arrays, and it is defined so that it occurs element-by-element just like with ufuncs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same is true for other arithmetical operations: any arithmetical operation between a number and an array will occur element-by-element.  It's also true for the power operation.  If an array is taken to a certain power, then every element of that array will be taken to that power.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Applying operations to more than one array\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way of manipulating arrays in `numpy` is to operate on more than one array.  You can, for example, apply the standard arithmetic operations and power operation to arrays just as you would with integers, floats, and complexes.  For example, suppose you create the following arrays:\n",
    "\n",
    "    A = np.array([1, 2, 3])\n",
    "    B = np.array([4, 5, 6])\n",
    "    \n",
    "Then I you add, subtract, multiply, and divide these two arrays:\n",
    "\n",
    "    A + B\n",
    "    A - B\n",
    "    A * B\n",
    "    A / B\n",
    "\n",
    "Some Caveats:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If an array contains a zero, you can't divide by it\n",
    "- Arrays have to have the same [shape](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.shape.html) -- we discuss array shape a bit more below.\n",
    "- Arrays having different numerical types will result in an array with the more \"general\" type.  E.g. if one array contains floats and the other contains ints, then adding them will result in an array with floats.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Built-in NumPy methods for manipulating arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "There are quite a few ways to manipulate arrays with built-in NumPy functions as well.  See the following link for an exhaustive list:\n",

    "### More on why we use arrays to avoid loops (aka vectorization)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many great reasons to use NumPy and SciPy.  One of them is to make your Python code run fast by eliminating loops which run slowly in python.  If you were to compare a simple program written in python and using lots of loops to an equivalent program written in some [lower-level language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-level_programming_language) like FORTRAN or C++, then you should find that the program written in the lower-level languages would be much faster because [loops in python are slow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8097408/why-python-is-so-slow-for-a-simple-for-loop).\n",
